Translate-Python-Cpp

Kalman filter is an core algorithm how self-driving car works to measure a distance and recognize a sign. Python is good at implementing something within a short period of time. However, it could not guarantee performance speed. C++ offsets Python's shortcoming to perform within a short time. 

How to run and see how it works?

1. Clone this repository and open terminal in your local machine. Make sure that depending on Operating System. In my case, I used Linux and run C++ program with GCC(G++) compiler.
2. Change directory to Translate-Python-Cpp and execute a command: g++ tests.cpp. A execute file will be created such as 'a.out' after the command.

3. Command './a.out' to run the file and see the result.
